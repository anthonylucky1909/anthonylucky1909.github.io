## Overview

Transformers are a foundational architecture in modern deep learning, particularly impactful in the field of natural language processing and sequence modeling. Introduced in the landmark paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017, Transformers employ self-attention mechanisms that allow the model to assess relationships between all elements of a sequence simultaneously. This approach overcomes the sequential processing limitations inherent in traditional RNNs and LSTMs, enabling highly parallelizable training and improved efficiency. Unlike decision tree models, which segment data recursively based on feature values, Transformers learn comprehensive sequence representations through multiple layers of attention and feed-forward networks, which has facilitated breakthroughs in machine translation, text summarization, and the development of large language models such as GPT and BERT.

## Transformer Architecture

The Transformer model consists of two primary components: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence and generates contextual embeddings for each token, while the decoder uses these embeddings along with previously generated outputs to produce the target sequence. Core elements of this architecture include embedding layers that transform discrete tokens into continuous vector representations, positional encodings that provide the model with information about the order of tokens in the sequence, multi-head self-attention mechanisms that allow the model to attend to different parts of the sequence simultaneously, feed-forward networks that transform attended representations, and layer normalization along with residual connections that stabilize training and improve gradient flow. This design enables the model to capture both local and global dependencies across the sequence efficiently.

## Positional Encoding

Since Transformers do not inherently process sequences in order, positional encodings are added to the token embeddings to inject information about token positions within the sequence. These encodings are defined using sine and cosine functions of different frequencies, allowing the model to distinguish between different positions and to generalize to sequences longer than those observed during training. Specifically, the positional encoding for a given position and dimension is computed as:

$$
PE_{(pos,2i)} = \sin(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{model}})\quad\text{and}\quad PE_{(pos,2i+1)} = \cos(pos / 10000^{2i/d_{model}})
$$

These encodings are added directly to the input embeddings to provide the model with explicit information about token order.

## Self-Attention Mechanism

The self-attention mechanism lies at the heart of the Transformer model, enabling each token in a sequence to consider the relevance of all other tokens when forming its representation. For each token, the model computes query, key, and value vectors, and the attention output is determined by the weighted sum of the value vectors, where the weights are obtained from a scaled dot-product of queries and keys followed by a softmax function. Formally, this is expressed as:

$$
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right) V
$$

Multi-head attention extends this mechanism by allowing the model to use multiple sets of queries, keys, and values in parallel, enabling it to capture different types of relationships and dependencies within the sequence.

## Transformer Implementation in PyTorch

The following PyTorch implementation defines a Transformer class that encapsulates the embedding layers, positional encoding, encoder and decoder layers, and the final linear projection for output prediction. The input and target sequences are first embedded and scaled by the square root of the embedding dimension, then enriched with positional encodings. The embedded inputs are passed through a stack of encoder layers to generate contextual representations, which are then used by the decoder layers along with the target embeddings to produce output predictions. Finally, a linear layer maps the decoder output to the target vocabulary space.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import math

from positional import PositionalEncoding
from encoder import EncoderLayer
from decoder import DecoderLayer

class Transformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim, num_encoder_layers,
                 num_decoder_layers, input_vocab_size, target_vocab_size,
                 max_seq_len, dropout=0.1):
        super().__init__()
        self.embed_dim = embed_dim
        self.input_embedding = nn.Embedding(input_vocab_size, embed_dim)
        self.target_embedding = nn.Embedding(target_vocab_size, embed_dim)
        self.positional_encoding = PositionalEncoding(embed_dim, max_seq_len)

        self.encoder_layers = nn.ModuleList([
            EncoderLayer(embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim, dropout)
            for _ in range(num_encoder_layers)
        ])
        
        self.decoder_layers = nn.ModuleList([
            DecoderLayer(embed_dim, num_heads, ff_dim, dropout)
            for _ in range(num_decoder_layers)
        ])

        self.output_linear = nn.Linear(embed_dim, target_vocab_size)

    def forward(self, src, tgt, src_mask=None, tgt_mask=None):
        enc_x = self.input_embedding(src) * math.sqrt(self.embed_dim)
        enc_x = self.positional_encoding(enc_x)

        dec_x = self.target_embedding(tgt) * math.sqrt(self.embed_dim)
        dec_x = self.positional_encoding(dec_x)

        for layer in self.encoder_layers:
            enc_x = layer(enc_x, mask=None)

        for layer in self.decoder_layers:
            dec_x = layer(dec_x, enc_x, tgt_mask=tgt_mask, src_mask=src_mask)

        output = self.output_linear(dec_x)
        return output
```

## Advantages of Transformers

Transformers provide highly parallelizable training compared to sequential RNNs and effectively capture long-range dependencies in sequences. They scale efficiently to large datasets and form the foundation of most modern natural language processing and multimodal models. Their flexibility, efficiency, and performance have made them the dominant architecture in machine translation, summarization, and generative modeling.
