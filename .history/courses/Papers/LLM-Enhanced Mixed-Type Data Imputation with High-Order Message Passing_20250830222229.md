The paper introduces a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with a **specialized graph network** to tackle the challenge of mixed-type data imputation in tabular datasets. At the heart of the approach is a **cell-oriented hypergraph representation**, where each table cell is treated as a node, while rows and columns are modeled as hyperedges. This design naturally captures both horizontal and vertical dependencies within the table. To process this structure, the authors propose the **BiHMP (Bidirectional Message Passing)** network, which enables information to flow between nodes and hyperedges in both directions. As a result, a missing value can be inferred not just from its row or column independently, but from the joint structural context of both.  

The framework further integrates the expressive power of LLMs, which are adept at understanding textual content such as column names and cell values. Through the **Xfusion module**, the semantic insights gained from the LLM are effectively fused with the structural signals extracted by the BiHMP network. To enhance efficiency and scalability, the method adopts a **pre-training and fine-tuning** strategy. Large tables are divided into smaller, manageable chunks, while a **progressive masking** mechanism gradually increases the complexity of the imputation taskâ€”starting with a few missing entries and scaling up to more challenging cases. Together, these components allow the model to learn nuanced dependencies across heterogeneous attributes, making it a powerful solution for realistic and accurate data imputation.
